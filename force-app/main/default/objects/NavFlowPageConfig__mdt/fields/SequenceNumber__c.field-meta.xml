    <description>Page sequence number in the flow. Use increments of 3 to allow flexibility to insert new pages in an existing flow. Example:
Flow sequence numbers : 3, 6, 9, 12
If a new page needs to be inserted as 3rd page then the order could be: 3, 6, 7, 9, 12

This way there is no need to change existing page sequence numbers.</description>
