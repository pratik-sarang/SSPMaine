        <value xsi:type="xsd:string">This Agreement applies to all Community Partners and to all persons using the kynect resources system or its information resources, and/or using, disclosing, creating, transmitting, or maintaining confidential information or sensitive information within the kynect resources system, whether employed by a Community Partner organization or not, and is based on policy delineated in the contractual agreement between the Community Partner and the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS). &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Client confidential Information is valuable and sensitive, and is protected by CHFS policies, as well as state and federal laws governing the confidentiality, privacy, and security of confidential information, including but not limited to: KRS Chapter 61.931 et seq.; Privacy Act of 1974; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA); Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); and 42 CFR Part 2. The intent of these laws and policies is to safeguard information against unauthorized use or disclosure in support of the organization&apos;s mission. Community Partners and their authorized users who access the kynect resources system are required to conform to all applicable laws and policies governing confidential information. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Community Partner organizations will not allow any of their users to access the kynect resources system before the user has received training on the use of the system, and on privacy and security requirements and procedures for maintaining confidentiality of client information. The organization shall be responsible for providing training at least annually to its users, and for retaining documentation of all training completed. The organization shall retain training documentation for a minimum of six years, and shall include the user’s name, the date the training was completed, and any additional training certifications. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Client consent will be required before any service information is entered into the system, or disclosed to any other Community Partner or user. Community Partners and their users will only enter or edit client information in the system for a client who is being served by that organization or user. No user will input information from clients into the system unless it is necessary to provide services, or for the purposes intended by the system. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Community Partners and their authorized users agree to use the system and client information for business purposes only. Community Partners and users may be granted access to referrals and inquiries made by or on behalf of other authorized kynect resources users. Information obtained through a referral shall not be used for any other purpose unless expressly authorized by kynect resources or by the individual whose information in the subject of the referral. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Community Partners are liable for use of the kynect resources system by the organization and by all authorized users under the organization’s control. kynect resources reserves the right to terminate any organization or user account access for misuse of the system and/or its information resources. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Community Partners will be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement if one is necessary to disclose or exchange Protected Health Information (PHI) with another entity. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Community Partners understand that resource data has been validated and provided by the United Way of the Bluegrass 2-1-1 system. It is the responsibility of the community partner organizations and United Way of the Bluegrass to ensure the resource data is up to date and accurate. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Community Partner organizations shall ensure that all users under its control who are allowed access to the kynect resources system will abide by the terms of this Agreement. The organization shall be responsible for ensuring that its users have read this Agreement, and have acknowledged acceptance of the terms herein. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Individual User Terms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Individual users with access to the kynect resources system agree to abide by the following additional terms: &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Users will abide by federal and state confidentiality laws and will not release confidential client records unless the client has given authorized, written consent. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Users acknowledge the responsibility to be aware of, to read, and to comply with CHFS’s security and privacy policies, standards, and controls. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Users shall not in any way create, use, disclose, transmit, maintain, copy, sell, loan, review, alter, or destroy any confidential information except as properly authorized within the scope of the user’s duties. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Users agree, at all times, to safeguard and retain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of confidential Information, even if the user no longer has access to the kynect resources system or its information resources. User obligations under this Agreement will continue after termination of the user’s association with, or access to, the kynect resources system until all confidential information in the user’s possession, custody or control is returned or destroyed as directed by CHFS. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

User IDs and passwords must be kept secure and shall not be shared. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Users have no right or ownership interest in any confidential information referred to in this Agreement. CHFS may revoke a user’s access code or other authorized access to confidential information at any time. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
